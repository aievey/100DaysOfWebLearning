I am starting this repository to save my practice codes. Also to keep track of regular updates for fun.
As I am following 100DaysOfWebDevelopment with Angela Yu. My goal is to keep updating this repository for the next 100 days.
I want to make my habit of coding again. I have been away for quite some time!
wish me luck!
